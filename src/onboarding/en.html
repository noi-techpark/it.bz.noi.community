										<p>NOISE</p>
									</div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>You find the NOISE just past the Infor&shy;mation Desk on the ground floor. It is a mix&shy;ture of library with stimu&shy;lating maga&shy;zines and a generous co-working area. There are up to 100 work&shy;stations, with power points and high-speed inter&shy;net ac&shy;cess. You can work, read and have small, infor&shy;mal meetings here. This area is <em>for everyone</em>, both inter&shy;nally and exter&shy;nally – just pop in and find your&shy;self a space, no regis&shy;tra&shy;tion needed. Open <em>Monday to Friday from 7:45 to 21:45</em> and <em>Saturday from 9:00 to 20:00</em>.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="largeFs text">
										<p>There are four semi&shy;nar rooms with fast inter&shy;net access and a screen or moni&shy;tor in each avail&shy;able to the NOI-Community. More infor&shy;mation about the rooms and their equip&shy;ment can be found here: <a href="https://noi.bz.it/en/booking/book-a-seminar-room">noi.bz.it/en/booking/book-a-seminar-room</a></p>

									<div class="text">
										<p>The spacious rooms at NOI can be booked at any time for work&shy;shops, semi&shy;nars and confe&shy;rences – and by the way, also for exter&shy;nal groups. It is impor&shy;tant, though, that the event matches the ethos of NOI – it should pri&shy;mar&shy;ily be about inspir&shy;ing and imparting know&shy;ledge, not sel&shy;ling and mar&shy;ket&shy;ing. If needed, our Meeting Manage&shy;ment is happy to support you in the orga&shy;ni&shy;sation of your event. Send all your enquiries to <a href="mailto:meetings@noi.bz.it">meetings@noi.bz.it</a></p>

									</div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>NOI’s architecture is thril&shy;ling: where we meet and work today was once a large alu&shy;minium plant. The pro&shy;duc&shy;tion hall of this former fac&shy;tory has been re&shy;stored for NOI and, with a length of 70 metres and a height of around 10 metres, offers plenty of space for special events.</p>

										<p>Yes, we do also have an open air theatre. We use this cov&shy;ered out&shy;door area for press confe&shy;rences and events, plays or concerts, but also as a casual every&shy;day meeting place.

										<p>Meeting Rooms</p>

									<div class="text">
										<p>There are <em>seven shared meeting rooms</em> in buil­d&shy;ings A1 and A2 for the NOI-Com&shy;mu&shy;nity. You can book them on&amp;shyline on <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/NOITechpark1@noi.bz.it/bookings/">rooms.noi.bz.it</a></p>
										<p>NB: users in the two build&shy;ings A1 + A2 may only book the meeting rooms in their own build&shy;ing. In build&shy;ing D1, on the other hand, each com&shy;pa&shy;ny has a meeting room on the same floor and in the same wing (East and West), all of which must be booked in advance. <em>The booking spreadsheet is available on Yammer under the section “Pinned”.</em></p>
