										<p>NOISE</p>
									</div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>You find the NOISE just past the Infor&shy;mation Desk on the ground floor. It is a mix&shy;ture of library with stimu&shy;lating maga&shy;zines and a generous co-working area. There are about 50 work&shy;stations, with power points and high-speed inter&shy;net ac&shy;cess. For important or private telephone or video calls, feel free to use one of the two phone booths. At the NOISE, you can work, read and have small, infor&shy;mal meetings here. This area is <em>for everyone</em>, both inter&shy;nally and exter&shy;nally – just pop in and find your&shy;self a space, no regis&shy;tra&shy;tion needed. Open <em>Monday to Friday from 7:45 to 21:45</em> and <em>Saturday from 9:00 to 20:00</em>.</p>

										<p>The spacious rooms at NOI can be booked at any time for work&shy;shops, semi&shy;nars and confe&shy;rences – and by the way, also for exter&shy;nal groups. It is impor&shy;tant, though, that the event matches the ethos of NOI – it should pri&shy;mar&shy;ily be about inspir&shy;ing and imparting know&shy;ledge, not sel&shy;ling and mar&shy;ket&shy;ing. If needed, our Meeting Manage&shy;ment is happy to support you in the orga&shy;ni&shy;sation of your event.

The pro&shy;duc&shy;tion hall of this former fac&shy;tory has been re&shy;stored for NOI and, with a length of 70 metres and a height of around 10 metres, offers plenty of space for special events.</p>
